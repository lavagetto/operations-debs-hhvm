Description: HipHop Virtual Machine, a JIT replacement for PHP
 HHVM is a new open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs
 written in PHP. HHVM uses a just-in-time (JIT) compilation approach to
 achieve superior performance while maintaining the flexibility that PHP
 developers are accustomed to.
 .
 For the majority of your programs HHVM should be a drop-in replacement for
 the usual PHP interpreter/engine. To date, HHVM (and its predecessor HPHPc
 before it) has realized over a 9x increase in web request throughput and
 over a 5x reduction in memory consumption for Facebook compared with the
 Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.
 .
 HHVM is developed by Facebook in the open.
