Description: HipHop Virtual Machine, a JIT replacement for PHP
 HHVM is a new open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs
 written in PHP. HHVM uses a just-in-time (JIT) compilation approach to
 achieve superior performance while maintaining the flexibility that PHP
 developers are accustomed to.
 .
 For the majority of your programs HHVM should be a drop-in replacement for
 the usual PHP interpreter/engine.
 .
 HHVM is developed by Facebook in the open.
