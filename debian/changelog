  * debian/patches:
    - folly: embed the upstream folly source, instead of upstream's git
      submodule that doesn't work well with Debian workflows.
    - prefer_libedit_over_libreadline: workaround build system bug
      and prefer libedit over libreadline.
    - generated_files_prebuild: allow generated_files.sh to be run
      before HHVM is built to run it for DFSG completeness reasons.
    - bison3_whitespace: support both Bison 2 & Bison 3's whitespace.
    - use_system_lz4: Use the system's liblz4 and remove the one
      in third-party.
