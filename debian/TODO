- Talk to the PHP team to make the binaries alternatives for /usr/bin/php.
- Write some examples or automatic scripts to create config in Apache/nginx/etc.
- Finish with 02_use_system_libzip.patch because we have to support the case when
  libzip 0.11 or later is not present.
- Write a manpage for hhvm and hphpize.
